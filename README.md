Data Analysis Project: Airbnb Listings Analysis

For this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb listings data to uncover insights and trends in the hospitality industry. Using advanced data analytics techniques, I extracted valuable insights from the dataset and visualized them in an interactive and easy-to-understand format using Tableau.

Key Findings:

Average Price per Bedroom:

I calculated the average price per bedroom across different Airbnb listings to understand the pricing dynamics in the market. This analysis helps both hosts and guests to make informed decisions about pricing and budgeting.
Distinct Count of Bedroom Listings:

By analyzing the distribution of bedroom listings, I provided insights into the variety and availability of accommodation options. This information is crucial for travelers to find accommodations that meet their specific needs and preferences.
Price by Zipcode:

I analyzed the pricing trends across different zip codes to identify areas with higher or lower average prices. This analysis helps hosts optimize their pricing strategy based on the location and demand, ultimately maximizing revenue.
Revenue for Year:

By aggregating the revenue generated from Airbnb listings over a specific period, I provided a comprehensive view of the financial performance of hosts. This analysis helps hosts to track their revenue growth and identify opportunities for improvement.
Methodology:

I collected the Airbnb listings data from AIRBNB website and performed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality.
Utilizing Tableau, I created interactive dashboards and visualizations to present the findings effectively.
I employed statistical techniques and data visualization best practices to derive meaningful insights from the data.
